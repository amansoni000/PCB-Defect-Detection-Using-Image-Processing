# PCB Defect Detection Using Image Processing

This project aims to detect and classify defects in PCBs using image processing techniques.



## Used Images

## Image Pre-Processing
Used multiple Image Pre-Processing Techniques to clean the images and reducig noises

Gray-Scaling

Median Filtering

Gausian Filtering

## Image Segmantation

Used Multi-level thresholding to sagment the images

## Defects

Classified defetcs as positive and nagative defects.
## Result

Nagateive defects shown as red color and Positive defects are shown as blue color
